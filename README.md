# CoreDiff: Contextual Error-Modulated Generalized Diffusion Model for Low-Dose CT Denoising and Generalization
This is the official implementation of the paper "CoreDiff: Contextual Error-Modulated Generalized Diffusion Model for Low-Dose CT Denoising and Generalization". The pre-print version can be found in [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01814); the early access version can be found in [TMI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268250).

## Updates
- Dec, 2023: Updated the code for preprocessing the original Mayo 2016 "DICOM" format data (`data_preporcess/prep_mayo2016.py`) and its corresponding training demo (`train_mayo2016.sh`).
- Oct, 2023: initial commit.


## Data Preparation
- The AAPM-Mayo dataset can be found from: [Mayo 2016](https://ctcicblog.mayo.edu/2016-low-dose-ct-grand-challenge/). 
- The "Low Dose CT Image and Projection Data" can be found from [Mayo 2020](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52758026#527580262a84e4aa87794b6583c78dccf041269f).
- The Piglet Dataset can be found from: [SAGAN](https://github.com/xinario/SAGAN).
- The Phantom Dataset can be found from: [XNAT](https://xnat.bmia.nl/app/template/XDATScreen_report_xnat_projectData.vm/search_element/xnat:projectData/search_field/xnat:projectData.ID/search_value/stwstrategyps4).


## Training & Inference
Please check `train.sh` for training script (or `test.sh` for inference script) once the data is well prepared. Specify the setting in the script, and simply run it in the terminal.

For one-shot learning frameworkï¼Œplease check `train_osl_framework_training.sh` for training script (or `test_osl_framework.sh` for inference script)

## Training loss and evaluation metrics. 
These curves are calculated based on our simulated 5% dose data.
